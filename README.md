# FourPartPy - Terminal Note Entry and Guitar Sound Synthesis with Python

### Guitar Sound Synthesis with Python
The guitar sound is synthesized with python using a buffer and the Karplus-Strong Algorithm, modeling a standard low-pass filter. The sound wave is then encrypted in byte form and converted into a wave file.

### Start Composing
Download the files and then start writing your own music using a terminal entry prompt by running "python3 inputterclass.py" in terminal or the command line. 

### Further projects from this code
I want to make a program which will analyze the music that people enter according to the four part writing rules created by Bach.
